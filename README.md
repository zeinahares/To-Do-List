# Workday To-Do List

## Description

I wanted to create a workday calendar to-do list using JQuery and Day.JS. 
It helps keep track of each to-do item with the hour of the day, changing colours to grey (past), red (current), and green (future).

This helped me learn a lot about JQUery syntax and Day.JS

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

When you open the page, you are presented with today's date and 1 hour timeslots from 9am-5pm.
You can press into each box and write down your task for that hour. Once you're done, press the save button on the right. Now your item is saved in local storage! If you referesh the page, your task item will still be there waiting for you, until you delete the text and press save.

Each timeslot is also color coded according to the time you opened the browser. If the hour matches the list's hour timeslot, it will have a red background. If the timeslot is in the past, it will be colored grey. If the timeslot is in the future, it will be colored green.
